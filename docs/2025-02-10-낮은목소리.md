# 오래간만에 공부하러 왔습니다.
```
I've just returned to studying after a long break. 

Not that any special motivated things.
I just hope to express my thought in English.
```

# 내가 어떤 상황을 말할 건데, 이 상황에 대해서 영어로 어떻게 표현할 수 있는지 알려줘.
```
I'm gonna tell you some situation, and I'd like to know how to express if in English.
```

# 내가 영어를 할 때, 한국어로 말할 때보다 더 낮은 목소리로 말을 하는데 
이게 다른 사람들이 생각하기에 영어를 잘한다고 오해하나봐. 
```
When I speak in English, I tend to speak more lower pitch
than speak in korean.

I think it's unconscious
because... I've learned from video of felix, who has a deep voice.

So, sometimes people utterly mistake me
for thinking I am good at English because of this.

=people mistakenly think i'm good at eng because of this.

I also heard that when people speak their native language, they use a lower pitch than other languages.

# 갑자기 미션: match
```
I am good at matching as a developer because many great developer wear glasses and check-patterned shirts,
which I also love.

I don't have any special situations that come to mind,
but... last christmas, i wore a knit with a nordic pattern featuring deer and snowflakes.

My peers complimented my style that day.
